# We need the build/ folder available to the backend during runtime
# By default, nixpacks copies the output.
# We need to make sure backend runs in 'backend/' dir but can see '../build'
# OR we run from root and point to 'backend.share:app'
# Let's run from 'backend' dir as CWD, so imports work.
# share.py looks in "../build". This is perfect.
